    	<h1 align="center"><b>Isabel Morais</b></h1><br>
    	<p>Isabel Morais grew up in Union, New Jersey, attending Union public schools her whole life. Ever since she was little, Isabel has had a drive to do better with herself. From ages 4 to 14, Isabel took TaeKwonDo, earning the rank of 3<sup>rd</sup> degree black belt and a 1<sup>st</sup> degree black belt in Haidong Gumdo, a Korean martial art focued on the sword. She would attend classes five to six times a week. When Isabel turned 14, she made the decision to leave TaeKwonDo to focus on her studies.</p>
    	<p>For three years in high school, Isabel took classes on Architecture, using AutoCad for her designs. During her junior year she found a passion in watching what she created on the computer come to life. That is when she started looking into Computer Science. With no prior knowledge, she applied to colleges with a Computer Science Major in mind and never looked back.</p>
    	<p>Isabel Morais will be a senior at Kean University this upcoming year, graduating in May 2019. She will be graduating with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. Isabel is currently looking for employment, so if you want to get in contact, click the link above or email her yourself at: moraisis@kean.edu.</p>
